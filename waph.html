  <h3>Web Application Programming and Hacking Course Information</h3>
    <p>UPDATE</p>
    <h3>Overview of Lab 0</h3>
    <p>In Lab 0 of my WAPH course, I focused on setting up my development environment and completing initial git exercises. In Part I, I set up an Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine on VirtualBox and installed necessary software and applications. This included configuring the environment to ensure compatibility with the course requirements. Part II involved git exercises where I cloned both the course repository and my private repository. I created SSH keys, added them to GitHub, and verified connectivity by committing changes from my VM to the remote repository. Additionally, I followed the provided template to write a report in Markdown format, converting it to PDF using pandoc. This lab ensured I had a functional development setup and foundational understanding of version control systems essential for the course.</p>
    <h3>Overview of Lab 1</h3>
    <p>
In Lab 1 of my WAPH course, I focused on learning about the fundamentals of the web and HTTP protocol. I started by using Wireshark to examine HTTP traffic. After installing Wireshark on my Ubuntu VM, I captured live network data and analyzed HTTP GET requests and server responses for http://example.com/index.html. In another task, I used telnet to manually send HTTP requests and compared these with browser-generated requests using Wireshark. Moving on to web application programming, I developed a "Hello World" CGI program in C, configured Apache2 to run it, and verified its functionality through a web browser. Additionally, I explored creating a simple PHP web application and studied the security risks associated with user inputs in PHP applications. Finally, I examined HTTP GET and POST requests using Wireshark, comparing their structures and responses. This lab provided foundational knowledge in web protocols, server-client interactions, and basic web programming techniques.</p>
    <h3>Overview of Lab 2</h3>
    <p>In Lab 2 of my WAPH course, I focused on front-end web development tasks across two main exercises. Task 1, covered in Lecture 4, involved creating an HTML file with basic tags, including an image and a form, and implementing JavaScript functionalities like displaying the current date/time, logging key presses, showing digital and analog clocks, and toggling email visibility. Task 2, covered in Lectures 5 and 6, expanded into Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API integration. I used Ajax to interact with echo.php for dynamic content updates, applied CSS styles across inline, internal, and external sheets, employed jQuery for Ajax requests and handling responses from the JokeAPI for programming jokes, and utilized the Fetch API to interact with the Agify API based on user inputs.</p>
    <h3>Overview of Hackathon 1</h3>
    <p>Hackathon 1 in my WAPH course focused on exploring cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and defenses. Task 1 involved performing seven levels of reflected XSS attacks on https://waph-hackathon.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/xss/. For each level (0-6), I injected code to display my name using alert() and documented the payload in browser screenshots. Additionally, for levels 2-6, I identified vulnerabilities in the echo.php web application exploited by the attacks. Task 2 focused on implementing defenses against XSS vulnerabilities. I reviewed and revised insecure code from Lab 1 (echo.php) and Lab 2 (current front-end prototype) by implementing input validation and encoding strategies. This included identifying external input channels, validating data inputs, and encoding outputs before display. Each revision was committed to GitHub with appropriate documentation and screenshots to illustrate code revisions.</p>
    <h3>Overview of Individual Project</h3>
    <p>Individual Project 1 in my WAPH course involved developing a Professional Profile Website deployed on GitHub Pages. The project aimed to showcase front-end web development skills with specific technical and non-technical requirements. For the general requirements, I created and deployed a personal website featuring my resume, including name, headshot, contact information, educational background, work experiences, and skills. Additionally, I created a dedicated page introducing the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and its related projects. Non-technical requirements were met by using Bootstrap for a responsive design tailored for potential employers, integrating a page tracker to monitor site visits. The technical requirements included implementing basic JavaScript functionalities such as digital and analog clocks, show/hide email functionality, and additional features from Lab 2. I integrated two public Web APIs, including the jokeAPI for displaying jokes dynamically and a public API for graphics/images. Moreover, I utilized JavaScript cookies to personalize user experience with messages based on their visit history.</p>
